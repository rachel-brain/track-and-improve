## User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view, create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance travelled. As the saying goes, you can't improve what you don't track.
